# gCodeLibJS

This is a g-code utility library for JavaScript.
I like using JavaScript for fast prototyping. Also I often use online tools. Because I don't like installing everything on my computers.
So, I thought that it would be a good idea to develop a library for g-code processing in JavaScript.


# Usage

Please see the comments in the gcode.lib.js file.
